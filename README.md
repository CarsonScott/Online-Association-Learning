# Concepts and Sequences

Conceptual relations are links between components of a spatial pattern (set of stimuli observed at the same time) while sequential relations are links between components of a temporal pattern (set of stimuli that is observed over a period of time). A spatial pattern represents a set of nodes connected by conceptual relations and a temporal pattern by sequential relations. A pattern reflects the connectivity between nodes of a network. The type of association between a given pair of nodes is based on the firing pattern of each node with respect to the other. Conceptual relations are formed when nodes fire simultaneously, while sequential relations are formed when nodes fire consecutively. Both types carry signals that propagate from node to node. A signal passed over a conceptual relation is received almost immediately after being sent, while a sequential relation delays the signal by some arbitrary amount of time.

A sequence is thus a chain  of nodes linked by sequential relations. The first node in the chain sends a signal to the second node, which is delayed by some amount of time. The second node becomes active once that signal is received, and produces another signal which propagates to the third, and so on. The result is a cascade of activity traveling between nodes in a specific order. The order is determined by repeated observations of activity, where the firing patterns of the nodes tend toward a specific arrangement through time, and the temporal difference between each node and the previous tend toward a specific value. A concept is a collection of nodes linked by conceptual relations. Each node is connected to a set of other nodes nearby in space. The result is a cascade of activity traveling between nodes in a cyclic manner. The configuration of is determined by repeated observations of activity, where the firing patterns of the nodes tend toward a specific arrangement over space, and the distance/angle between them tend toward specific values.

Sequences, being a product of time, require just one dimension for an accurate representation of their patterns. However, concepts exist in space and therefore cannot be represented in the same way. Both have an interval, distance and delay, which are equivalent in that they measure the difference between two things. Objects in two-dimensional space are related through measurements of distance and rotation to represent their differences in space.
